        <h4>About Us</h4>
        <p>VIVCOM Foundation- Vision for Vulnerable Communities Foundation (founded in 2012) is a registered Charity Non-governmental Community based organization No.WCBO/1605/15. Our physical office location is in Nabweru, Wakiso District (Uganda).</p>
          </br>

          <h4>Vision:</h4>
           <p>To see an empowered, enlightened and equipped community for sustainable development.</p>

          <h4>Mission:</h4>
          <p>We stimulate Vulnerable Communities to enhance viable growth.</p>
          </div>

          <h4>Our strategy/ model of operation</h4>
          <p>The VIVCOM Foundation Model of operation will be duplicated in all the communities we operate.We identify vulnerable homesand establish a net worked homestead i.e. big extended family to which we jointly work towards improving the standards of living of the entire home stead through empowerment. Empowerment to us means each single home in the home stead initiates an idea, innovates or adds value to that idea, grows the idea and replicates the idea to the wider home stead. As VIVCOM we acknowledge that families meet different challenges and we therefore encourage our families to participate actively in the choice of a remedy to the problems they face, hence the more choices the families make in lessening the problems they face, the more empowered they become, such remedies can therefore be transferred to others families in the wider home stead facing such similar challenges. VIVCOM provides a complete extended family structure where society members are mindful, responsible, compassionate and care for others holistically. This networked family system aims at providing physical, emotional, spiritual and financial support to the wider home stead. VIVCOM Foundation will stretch out into farming, technical and vocational education as a means of sustainability and as another layer to strengthen the home steads.</p>

          <h4>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h4>
          <p>Household and family vulnerability levels in Uganda expose children to high risks of malnutrition, homelessness and severe impoverishment. Such households cannot provide basic needs to family members and the children, such as education, proper shelter or even feed their children. These families therefore thrive in destitute and insolvent circumstances.</p></br>
          
          <p>The vulnerability levels in Ugandan households occur in threefold, symbolic measures manifest themselves in insurmountable rates and Critically Vulnerable households exhaust traits such as orphaned households, Families with children infected and affected with HIV, Child Headed Households and Children with Disability. Moderately vulnerable households exemplify traits such as elderly headed households, impoverished families as well as families in fishing communities, generally vulnerable households include single headed households where parents separated or divorced, households in bad/poor housing facilities, polygamous households and households in slum communities.</p></br>
          
          <p>Vision for Vulnerable Communities Foundation has resorted to empowering such households by ushering them to a better living as compared to what they had before through helping the absolute poor to make a great impact on the society and thereby decreases the poverty burden in the country.</p><!-- </div>  -->

        <p>My name is Syrill Kizza, a Social Entrepreneur, Motivational speaker and a child rights advocate.

        <p>With such a restive past Syrill is extremely passionate about helping vulnerable families and children dwelling in slum communities to offset the enormous challenges they face with a robust belief that they can succeed and become responsible leaders tomorrow.</p>

        <p>To Syrill charity is a calling to proclaim good news to the poor, brokenhearted and the hurting world, “Christ asked us to show mercy to the poor, the sick and the needy, this in effect is ministering to Him personally and we shall be rewarded accordingly.<b>(Mathew 25:35-40).</b></p>

        <p>My name is Abraham Olupot a born of 1st-January-1989 and raised in Kampala Slums. Charity to me is honoring God’s calling upon my life and a way to walk and follow the footsteps of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who commends us to love God and also our neighbors with all the heart, spirit and soul.</p>
        <p>It’s true you cannot love without giving, I have therefore devoted to giving my time, influence, energy and resources to helping the less privileged and critically vulnerable members in the slum communities in my society. Having grown up and bred in a slum community Abraham is extremely zealous to see a transformed society where families better their Standards of living, Children can obtain basic necessities and families are empowered to be self-reliant.</p>

        <h5 class="ctitle">DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION</h5>
        <p>My name is Kisinde Rogers Arthur, I am a born of February-14th-1988 in Kampala, Uganda, my passion of helping the orphans and vulnerable children grew as a result of in-depth kindness as I grew up watching the life of the marginalized children in my neighborhood, Accessing Education, having basic needs was unheard of in the slum communities they were living in, as a child I was friends with these deprived children, so whenever I got something small like bread, sweets, food, I would always put them aside in my small bag and share them with my friends who could not afford to have them though much as they were in need of them.</p>

        <p>As time passed by and need arose I started giving my personal items like clothes, toys to my poor friends the happiness on my friend’s faces make me recall each day that ‘every contribution counts in the lives of the less fortunate’’ this from then till date is my secret of giving. “He who gives to the poor lends to God’</p>

        <p>My name is Brenda Econia, born on 1st-December-1995. I am an Orphan raised in Police barracks, my father having served our country died in a motor accident in the line of duty, this living me and 5 my siblings as partial orphans since my father was the sole bread winner of the family, life became so unspeakable forcing us to relocate to a very affordable house in the slum characterized by shanty housing set ups, poor drainage systems and with barely a meal a day for I and my family. My education life culminated with a lot of turmoil since I had to double school with child labor to make ends meet at such a tender age.</p>

        <p>The plight of my childhood memories instigate my spirit of volunteering and doing charity work so as to help the underprivileged like myself earn a sense of belonging and at least acquire the very basic necessities in life. ‘Give freely to the poor and do not wish that you didn’t have to give, then the Lord your God will bless your work and everything you do”. <b>Deuteronomy 15:10.</b> </p>

        <p>Godfrey is extremely enthusiastic about offsetting abject poverty in slum areas which has critically championed people’s choices in life, by rendering them as an inferior component society, he is therefore passionate to serve such marginalized families by impacting them for defensible growth which can secure families and the children therein. ‘You have not made the week strong, bandaged those that are hurt nor brought back those who strayed away and yet you rule the sheep with cruelty”. <b>(Ezekiel 34:4)</b></p>
