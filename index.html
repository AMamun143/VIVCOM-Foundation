          <h4>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</h4>
          <p>Household and family vulnerability levels in Uganda expose children to high risks of malnutrition, homelessness and severe impoverishment. Such households cannot provide basic needs to family members and the children, such as education, proper shelter or even feed their children. These families therefore thrive in destitute and insolvent circumstances.</p></br>
          
          <p>The vulnerability levels in Ugandan households occur in threefold, symbolic measures manifest themselves in insurmountable rates and Critically Vulnerable households exhaust traits such as orphaned households, Families with children infected and affected with HIV, Child Headed Households and Children with Disability. Moderately vulnerable households exemplify traits such as elderly headed households, impoverished families as well as families in fishing communities, generally vulnerable households include single headed households where parents separated or divorced, households in bad/poor housing facilities, polygamous households and households in slum communities.</p></br>
          
          <p>Vision for Vulnerable Communities Foundation has resorted to empowering such households by ushering them to a better living as compared to what they had before through helping the absolute poor to make a great impact on the society and thereby decreases the poverty burden in the country.</p></div>

        <h4>Syrill Kizza</h4>
        <h5 class="ctitle">EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND FOUNDER</h5>
        <p>My name is Syrill Kizza, a Social Entrepreneur, Motivational speaker and a child rights advocate. I am a born of December- 17th – 1989 in Kampala (Uganda). I was born and raised in a slum area as an Orphan, Having lost my mother at a tender age of 5 years, Life became so difficult for me and my siblings, I being the last born of the 4 children my mum had given birth too, I went through a lot of oppression, I was subjected to child labor in order to put food and scholastic materials on my table, so having struggled with having basic needs and a good Education, this exposed me to a lot of challenges in life which included child rights abuse, but with hard work and determination, I overcame the oppression and this arouse my passion to help children in need succeed in life and become responsible leaders of tomorrow.</p>

        <p>When God was looking around the world, He said whom shall I send and anoint with the Holy Spirit to proclaim good news to the poor, to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and give direction to the blind, to set at liberty to those who are oppressed, to comfort all those that mourn, I said here I am. Doing charity is a calling and many are called but a few are chosen and that is ‘‘Me and You’’ who are called.</p>

        <p>Jesus Christ said that those who show mercy to the poor, the sick, and the needy are in effect ministering to Him personally <b>(Matthew 25:35–40)</b> and will be rewarded accordingly.</p>

        <p>Children are our future. But for many, that future is uncertain. Lives shaped by war, poverty, hunger, exploitation, abuse, natural disasters and lack of opportunity at a young age are indescribably distressing. Include the loss of love, support and comfort of family life and an orphaned child is the most tragic and poignant symbol of heartbreak imaginable.</p>

        <p>Throughout the world, the scale of orphan suffering runs into the millions. In countries where the social infrastructure is challenging, it is all too easy for the plight of young lives to assume a low profile. Orphaned children are deserving of global compassion. There is an increasing urgency to break the negative cycle of deprivation.</p>

        <p>What good is it, my brothers and sisters, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him? If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food, and one of you says to them, “Go in peace, be warmed and filled,” without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. <b>(James 2:14-17)</b></p>

        <p>Let us not love with words or tongue but with action and in truth” <b>(1 John 3:17–18).</b></p>

        <h4>Abraham Olupot</h4>
        <h5 class="ctitle">PROGRAM DIRECTOR</h5>
        <p>My name is Abraham Olupot a born of 1st-January-1989 and raised in Kampala Slums. Charity to me is honoring God’s calling upon my life and as a way to walk and follow the footsteps of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who clearly said to us that the greatest commandments are  to Love God with all your heart ,body, spirit and soul plus all your belongings and Love your neighbor as you love yourself. Jesus Christ displayed the love of the poor by attending to them whenever they came to seek for any assistance from him, He displayed this character by doing servant leadership for example when He washed the feet of His disciples, He eat with the poor, the less privileged, and He once said He did not come for the upright but for those in need. God still encourages the spirit of giving to Humanity by giving to us his only Beloved Son Jesus Christ who died for our sins and brought salvation unto us, so in giving you save a soul from perishing and extend the love of God on Earth since you will be a vessel God will be using to reach out to his people, and giving is a double edged sword, where the receiver attains the basic needs and this build the kingdom of God on Earth and the poor will be praising His Holy name Jesus Christ for Remembering them, and to the giver it is an eternity saving and God rewards you with blessings both in Heaven and on Earth. “He who closes his eyes to [the poor] receives many curses.” <b>(Proverbs 28:27)</b></p>
        <p>LORD your God redeemed and saved you from your past situation and therefore He commands you to do this. “When you reap your harvest in your field and forget a sheaf in the field, you shall not go back to get it. It shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow, that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands. When you beat your olive trees, you shall not go over them again. It shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow. When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not strip it afterward. It shall be for the sojourner, the fatherless, and the widow. <b>(Deuteronomy 24:17-21)</b></p>

        <h4>Brenda Econia</h4>
        <h5 class="ctitle">GENERAL SECRETARY</h5>
        <p>My name is Brenda Econia, I am a born of 1st-December-1995. I am an Orphan, my father was a police officer doing service to our country, I grew up living in the Police barracks which was more of a slum setting, since houses where packed with poor drainage systems. My Father died in line of duty in a motor accident caused by early mist and fog, He could no longer  clearly see images that were in front, sideways and backwards, Him being the one driving during the incident, This left me and my siblings as partial Orphans, Our father was the bread winner of our family, and ever since he passed away, my mother could not take good care of us since she had a lot of responsibilities to take care of we the 5 children who happen to be my biological siblings. My Education and life was full of struggles trying to make ends meet but by the grace of God, I was able to attain basic formal education.</p>

        <p>This spirit of volunteering and doing charity work become part of me because I too being a victim to such, I made a promise to God that if He lifts me and provides to me the basic needs in life, I will also use the small available resources to take care of the underprivileged like me to earn a sense of belonging in life by having basic education and a place they call home, I joined VIVCOM Foundation so that I can be the ‘‘voice of the voiceless’’ , The mother of the Orphans!</p>

        <p>According to the latest statistics, over 840 million people worldwide are chronically undernourished. Every day, 26,000 young children die due to poverty, hunger, and preventable diseases. With so much of the world’s population in such lamentable condition, we respond by  Giving generously to needy and do so without a grudging heart; then because of this the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in everything you put your hand to” <b>(Deuteronomy 15:10).</b></p>

        <p><b>“Whoever is kind to the needy honors God!” Proverbs 14:31</b></p>

        <h4>Lukanga Musoke Godfrey</h4>
        <h5 class="ctitle">TREASURER</h5>
        <p>My name is Lukanga Musoke Godfrey, born on 22nd-June-1990 in Kampala slums, my life was full of challenges, hardships, discomfort and a series of disappointment, living in the ghetto taught me many lessons in life, that being poor in life confronts you with all sorts of diminishing behaviors like drug abuse, prostitution and the list is endless, This abject poverty champions the choices in your life, since your voice is always inferior in the community. Children are confronted with a lot of challenges which a few can overcome and the rest fail and end up becoming un-fit in society.</p>

        <p>So I joined VIVCOM Foundation to use my skills to bring impact in the marginalized communities and empower them for sustainable development but this vision can be realized if you different stakeholders join hands with us to make the future of the children secured.</p>

        <p>Behold children are a heritage from the Lord, the fruit of the womb a reward, like arrows in the hand of a warrior are the children of one’s youth. Blessed is the man who fills his quiver with them! He shall not be put to shame when he speaks with his enemies in the gate. <b>Psalms127:3-5</b></p>


        <p>For God has chosen me and you to nurture our children and our household after him to keep the way of the Lord by doing righteousness and justice, God uses us as vessels to reach out to the oppressed and deprived communities so that the Lord may bring to us Blessings and Favor He promised to our fore fathers like Abraham.” <b>(Genesis 18:19)</b></p>  

        <p>Remember the Bible tells us not to merely listen to the word of God but to do what it says, Take what your read here, write it down and put it into action! <b>(James 1:22)</b></p>

        <h4>Kisinde Rogers Arthur</h4>
        <h5 class="ctitle">DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION</h5>
        <p>My name is Kisinde Rogers Arthur, I am a born of February-14th-1988 in Kampala, Uganda, my passion of helping the orphans and vulnerable children grew as a result of in-depth kindness as I grew up watching the life of the marginalized children in my neighborhood, Accessing Education, having basic needs was unheard of in the slum communities they were living in, as a child I become friends with the deprived children, so whenever I got something small like bread, sweets, food, I would always put them aside in my small bag and share them with my friends who could not afford to have them though they were in need of them, we shared game toys, and I used to even give them some of my personal clothes that I no longer needed, and these my poor friends showered my life with thanks and blessings for God to make me live for long and to give me all what my heart desired, so this made me realize that ‘ ‘ Every contribution counts in the lives of the less fortunate’’ and when time went on, this become an adopted culture in me of giving and not only that, whenever I could lend a helping hand, God continually blessed me and doubled my portion, This made me to realize the secret in giving, I relate this to a bible scripture that says Blessed is that hand that gives, than the hand that takes and our Lord Jesus Christ said, ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’”</p>

        <p><b>Deuteronomy 14:29</b> ‘‘Lord your God may bless you in all the work of your hands that do so.’’  God calls His people to specifically remember orphans in their giving. You can become a sponsor, donate to a project, or help to setup a donation jar at your place of work, church, supermarket and sports events avenues. Caring for orphans and vulnerable children in distress is a calling from God, take heart! He, who calls you to this work, will be faithful to equip you for the work he has called you to! For God who calls you is faithful, He can be trusted to make it so. <b>(1 Thess.5:24).</b></p>

        <p><b>Remember if a man shuts his ears to the cry of the poor, he will cry out and not be answered. (Proverbs 21:13)</b></p>
