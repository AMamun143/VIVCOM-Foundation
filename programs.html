Volunteers have the   opportunity to get to work with people in the community and begin to understand the local context while engaging with the community they are supporting. We emphasize hands-on learning and cultural exchange.

          <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>Agricultural project/ granary/ food basket</h4>
          <h4>Farming</h4>
          <p>VIVCOM Foundation stretches out into agriculture and the vision homes work towards contributing to the food security of the entire homestead, this begins when the Vision homestead identifies a project that seems tenable to support the entire stead granary/ food basket, each vision home is required to do some rearing so as to improve on the family income as well as supplement the home diet. During the holiday (School break) Vision children have a program of visiting the agricultural projects of their homesteads so that they get involved in the work going on as well as learn hands on.</p>

          <h4>Feeding program</h4>
          <p>VIVCOM concedes that most of the vulnerable households thrive on one or no meal a day and this has negatively affected families forcing children into dubious acts such as child labor, petty commercial sex and school drop outs to fend for their families, VIVCOM therefore asserts with the VIVCOM feeding program which is composed of food commodities both donated and those generated from the VIVCOM agricultural projects as well as projects initiated by the Vision homesteads such a vice can be toppled.</p>
          
          <p>VIVCOM therefore works with any well-wisher individual, or organization with a philanthropic desire to extend a donation, grant or any contribution to the VIVCOM Food Basket (VFB) i.e. the feeding program.</p>

          </div>
      
          <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>Social & Spiritual Development</h4>
          <p>VIVCOM believes vision families are the basic units of all social and spiritual development because they are the primary sources of socialization, which moral obligation can be copied or transferred to the wider <b>Vision Homestead;</b> the vision homes are a good example and agents of change to other homes in the community.</p>

          <p>With the VIVCOM physical- social network its incumbent upon members of the wider stead to ensure that children and members act morally upright in a manner that is befitting in the homestead and in society. Through the vision Social Capital Trust (VSCT) vision homes build relationships based on trust to instill a habit of helping one another in times of need, as VIVCOM we believe trust is the foundation upon which relationships thrive. In order to strengthen such relationships we strongly emphasize exchange visits amongst vision families where the host family not only feeds the visiting family but also gives a valuable gift that can be reproductive and thereby improving the standard of living of the visiting family, this makes the vision exchange visits more productive while the other family witnesses that such a gift grows to benefit the receiver family. <b>Proverbs 21:28.</b></p>

          <p>During the week vision families meet in homestead cells to draw inspiration from the word of God and VIVCOM identifies competent persons who could come to share as well as talk to the vision families through VIVCOM speaker series, this gives encouragement as well as share of experience with such persons deemed suitable.</p>

          </div>
      
          <div class="col-lg-6">
          <h4>SPORTS AND LEISURE</h4>
          <p>VIVCOM engages all vision children in many extra-curricular activities, such as soccer, Music Dance and Drama, which helps to foster the psycho-social development of the children. Youth workers, operating under the social work umbrella, facilitate activities (interpersonally and in groups) which helps the children deal with and overcome any trauma and brokenness from their past, VIVCOM identifies places deemed fit for children to engage in sports and leisure, vision parents during such events hand the children to the VIVCOM sports coordinators.</p>

          <p>VIVCOM believes children have inherent talent and profound abilities, which if well harvested, can be beneficial to these children and the community as a whole; it’s from this perspective that VIVCOM identifies talented members such as athletes, artists, doctors and from various professions both locally and internationally to inspire vision children.</p></div>
